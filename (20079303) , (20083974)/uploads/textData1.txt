Reading directories
Path.iterdir()
When the path points to a directory, yield path objects of the directory contents:

>>>
p = Path('docs')
for child in p.iterdir(): child

PosixPath('docs/conf.py')
PosixPath('docs/_templates')
PosixPath('docs/make.bat')
PosixPath('docs/index.rst')
PosixPath('docs/_build')
PosixPath('docs/_static')
PosixPath('docs/Makefile')
The children are yielded in arbitrary order, and the special entries '.' and '..' are not included. If a file is removed from or added to the directory after creating the iterator, it is unspecified whether a path object for that file is included.

If the path is not a directory or otherwise inaccessible, OSError is raised.
